# Portfolio website

### Description
This is my portfolio site which shows a selection of my projects, certificates and contact details organized in a better way.
It's a one page website with multiple sections, e.g. 'about me', 'skills', 'work', 'contact'. 
In this repository you are able to see earlier projects as well (in the projects folder), which are not showcased via the website anymore.
