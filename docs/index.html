            This article will recap some of the CSS layout features we've
            already touched upon in previous modules — such as different display
            values — and introduce some of the concepts we'll be covering
            throughout this module.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prerequisites: The basics of HTML (study
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML"
              >Introduction to HTML</a
            >), and an idea of How CSS works (study
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps"
              >Introduction to CSS</a
            >.) <br />Objective: To give you an overview of CSS page layout
            techniques. Each technique can be learned in greater detail in
            subsequent tutorials.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a
            web page and control where they are positioned relative to their
            default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around
            them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window. The page
            layout techniques we'll be covering in more detail in this module
            are
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Normal flow</li>
            <li>The display property</li>
            <li>Flexbox Grid</li>
            <li>Floats</li>
            <li>Positioning</li>
            <li>Table layout</li>
            <li>Multiple-column layout</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each technique has its uses, advantages, and disadvantages, and no
            technique is designed to be used in isolation. By understanding what
            each method is designed for you will be in a good place to
            understand which is the best layout tool for each task.

        <header><h2>Normal flow</h2></header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when
            you do nothing to control page layout. Let's look at a quick HTML
            example:
          </p>
          <pre class="code-blocks"><code>&lt;p&gt;I love my cat.&lt;/p&gt; 
            
&lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Buy catfood&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Exercise&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Cheer up friend&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end!&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>By default, the browser will display this code as follows:</p>
          <div class="code-blocks">
            <p>I love my cat.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Buy cat food</li>
              <li>Exercise</li>
              <li>Cheer up friend</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The end!</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Note here how the HTML is displayed in the exact order in which it
            appears in the source code, with elements stacked up on top of one
            another — the first paragraph, followed by the unordered list,
            followed by the second paragraph.
          </p>
          <p>
            The elements that appear one below the other are described as
            <em>block</em> elements, in contrast to <em>inline</em> elements,
            which appear one beside the other, like the individual words in a
            paragraph.
          </p>
          <p class="important-note">
            <strong>Note</strong>: The direction in which block element contents
            are laid out is described as the Block Direction. The Block
            Direction runs vertically in a language such as English, which has a
            horizontal writing mode. It would run horizontally in any language
            with a Vertical Writing Mode, such as Japanese. The corresponding
            Inline Direction is the direction in which inline contents (such as
            a sentence) would run.
          </p>
          <p>
            For many of the elements on your page the normal flow will create
            exactly the layout you need, however for more complex layouts you
            will need to alter this default behavior using some of the tools
            available to you in CSS. Starting with a well-structured HTML
            document is very important, as you can then work with the way things
            are laid out by default rather than fighting against it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The methods that can change how elements are laid out in CSS are as
            follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The display property</strong> — Standard values such as
              <code>block</code>, <code>inline</code> or
              <code>inline-block</code> can change how elements behave in normal
              flow, for example making a block-level element behave like an
              inline element (see
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#block_and_inline_boxes"
                >Types of CSS boxes</a
              >
              for more information). We also have entire layout methods that are
              switched on via specific <code>display</code> values, for example
              CSS Grid and Flexbox, which alter how elements inside the element
              they are set on are laid out.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Floats</strong> — Applying a float value such as
              <code>left</code> can cause block level elements to wrap alongside
              one side of an element, like the way images sometimes have text
              floating around them in magazine layouts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The position property</strong> — Allows you to precisely
              control the placement of boxes inside other boxes.
              <code>static</code>
              positioning is the default in normal flow, but you can cause
              elements to be laid out differently using other values, for
              example always fixed to the top of the browser viewport.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Table layout</strong> — features designed for styling the
              parts of an HTML table can be used on non-table elements using
              <code>display: table</code> and associated properties.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Multi-column layout</strong> — The Multi-column layout
              properties can cause the content of a block to layout in columns,
              as you might see in a newspaper.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <article>
          <p>
            The main methods of achieving page layout in CSS are all values of
            the <code>display</code> property. This property allows us to change
            the default way something displays. Everything in normal flow has a
            value of display, used as the default way that elements they are set
            on behave. For example, the fact that paragraphs in English display
            one below the other is due to the fact that they are styled with
            <code>display: block</code>. If you create a link around some text
            inside a paragraph, that link remains inline with the rest of the
            text, and doesn’t break onto a new line. This is because the
            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element is <code>display: inline</code> by
            default.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can change this default display behavior. For example, the
            <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element is <code>display: block</code> by
            default, meaning that list items display one below the other in our
            English document. If we change the display value to
            <code>inline</code> they now display next to each other, as words
            would do in a sentence. The fact that you can change the value of
            <code>display</code> for any element means that you can pick HTML
            elements for their semantic meaning, without being concerned about
            how they will look. The way they look is something that you can
            change.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to being able to change the default presentation by
            turning an item from <code>block</code> to <code>inline</code> and
            vice versa, there are some bigger layout methods that start out as a
            value of <code>display</code>. However, when using these, you will
            generally need to invoke additional properties. The two values most
            important for our purposes when discussing layout are
            <code>display: flex</code> and <code>display: grid</code>.
          </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="flexbox">
        <header><h2>Flexbox</h2></header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Flexbox is the short name for the Flexible Box Layout Module,
            designed to make it easy for us to lay things out in one dimension —
            either as a row or as a column. To use flexbox, you apply
            <code>display: flex</code> to the parent element of the elements you
            want to lay out; all its direct children then become flex items. We
            can see this in a simple example.
          </p>
          <p>
            The HTML markup below gives us a containing element, with a class of
            <code>wrapper</code>, inside which are three
            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements. By default these would display as
            block elements, below one another, in our English language document.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if we add <code>display: flex</code> to the parent, the
            three items now arrange themselves into columns. This is due to them
            becoming <em>flex items</em> and being affected by some initial
            values that flexbox sets on the flex container. They are displayed
            in a row, because the initial value of
            <code>flex-direction</code> set on their parent is <code>row</code>.
            They all appear to stretch to the height of the tallest item,
            because the initial value of the <code>align-items</code> property
            set on their parent is <code>stretch</code>. This means that the
            items stretch to the height of the flex container, which in this
            case is defined by the tallest item. The items all line up at the
            start of the container, leaving any extra space at the end of the
            row.
          </p>
          <pre class="code-blocks"><code>.wrapper{
  display: flex;
}</code></pre>
          <pre class="code-blocks"><code>&lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;
  &lt;div class="box1"&gt;One&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="box2"&gt;Two&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="box3"&gt;Three&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
          <iframe
            src="https://ullavs.nl/docs/example1.html"
            frameborder="0"
          ></iframe>
          <p>
            In addition to the above properties that can be applied to the flex
            container, there are properties that can be applied to the flex
            items. These properties, among other things, can change the way that
            the items flex, enabling them to expand and contract to fit into the
            available space.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a simple example of this, we can add the
            <code>flex</code> property to all of our child items, with a value
            of <code>1</code>. This will cause all of the items to grow and fill
            the container, rather than leaving space at the end. If there is
            more space then the items will become wider; if there is less space
            they will become narrower. In addition, if you add another element
            to the markup the items will all become smaller to make space for it
            — they will adjust size to take up the same amount of space,
            whatever that is.
          </p>

          <p>
            While flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout, Grid Layout is
            designed for two dimensions — lining things up in rows and columns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once again, you can switch on Grid Layout with a specific value of
            display — <code>display: grid</code>. The below example uses similar
            markup to the flex example, with a container and some child
            elements. In addition to using <code>display: grid</code>, we are
            also defining some row and column tracks on the parent using the
            <code>grid-template-rows</code> and
            <code>grid-template-columns</code> properties respectively. We've
            defined three columns each of <code>1fr</code> and two rows of
            <code>100px</code>. I don’t need to put any rules on the child
            elements; they are automatically placed into the cells our grid has
            created.
          </p>
          <pre class="code-blocks"><code>.wrapper{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
    grid-gap: 10px;
}</code></pre>
          <pre class="code-blocks"><code>&lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;
    &lt;div class="box1"&gt;One&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="box2"&gt;Two&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="box3"&gt;Three&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="box4"&gt;Four&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="box5"&gt;Five&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="box6"&gt;Six&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
          <iframe
            src="https://ullavs.nl/docs/example3.html"
            frameborder="0"
          ></iframe>
          <p>
            Once you have a grid, you can explicitly place your items on it,
            rather than relying on the auto-placement behavior seen above. In
            the second example below we have defined the same grid, but this
            time with three child items. We've set the start and end line of
            each item using the <code>grid-column</code> and
            <code>grid-row</code> properties. This causes the items to span
            multiple tracks.
          </p>
          <pre class="code-blocks"><code>.wrapper{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
    grid-gap: 10px;
}

.box1 {
    grid-column: 2 / 4;
    grid-row: 1;
}

.box2 {
    grid-column: 1;
    grid-row: 1 / 3;
}

.box3 {
    grid-column: 3;
    grid-row: 2;
}</code></pre>
          <pre class="code-blocks"><code>&lt;div class="wrapper"&gt;
    &lt;div class="box1"&gt;One&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="box2"&gt;Two&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="box3"&gt;Three&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

            The rest of this guide covers other layout methods, which are less
            important for the main layout structures of your page but can still
            help you achieve specific tasks. By understanding the nature of each
            layout task, you will soon find that when you look at a particular
            component of your design the type of layout best suited to it will
            often be clear.

          <p>
            Floating an element changes the behavior of that element and the
            block level elements that follow it in normal flow. The element is
            moved to the left or right and removed from normal flow, and the
            surrounding content floats around the floated item.
          </p>
          <p>The float property has four possible values:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>left</code> - Floats the element to the left.</li>
            <li><code>right</code> - Floats the element to the right.</li>
            <li>
              <code>none</code> - Specifies no floating at all. This is the
              default value.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>inherit</code> - Specifies that the value of the
              <code>float</code> property should be inherited from the element's
              parent element.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In the example below we float a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> left, and
            give it a <code>margin</code> on the right to push the text away
            from the element. This gives us the effect of text wrapped around
            that box, and is most of what you need to know about floats as used
            in modern web design.
