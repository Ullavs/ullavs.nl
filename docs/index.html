            This article will recap some of the CSS layout features we've
            already touched upon in previous modules — such as different display
            values — and introduce some of the concepts we'll be covering
            throughout this module.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prerequisites: The basics of HTML (study
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML"
              >Introduction to HTML</a
            >), and an idea of How CSS works (study
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps"
              >Introduction to CSS</a
            >.) <br />Objective: To give you an overview of CSS page layout
            techniques. Each technique can be learned in greater detail in
            subsequent tutorials.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a
            web page and control where they are positioned relative to their
            default position in normal layout flow, the other elements around
            them, their parent container, or the main viewport/window. The page
            layout techniques we'll be covering in more detail in this module
            are
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Normal flow</li>
            <li>The display property</li>
            <li>Flexbox Grid</li>
            <li>Floats</li>
            <li>Positioning</li>
            <li>Table layout</li>
            <li>Multiple-column layout</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each technique has its uses, advantages, and disadvantages, and no
            technique is designed to be used in isolation. By understanding what
            each method is designed for you will be in a good place to
            understand which is the best layout tool for each task.

        <header><h2>Normal flow</h2></header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when
            you do nothing to control page layout. Let's look at a quick HTML
            example:
          </p>
          <pre class="code-blocks"><code>&lt;p&gt;I love my cat.&lt;/p&gt; 
            
&lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Buy catfood&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Exercise&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Cheer up friend&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end!&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
          <p>By default, the browser will display this code as follows:</p>
          <div class="code-blocks">
            <p>I love my cat.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Buy cat food</li>
              <li>Exercise</li>
              <li>Cheer up friend</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The end!</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Note here how the HTML is displayed in the exact order in which it
            appears in the source code, with elements stacked up on top of one
            another — the first paragraph, followed by the unordered list,
            followed by the second paragraph.
          </p>
          <p>
            The elements that appear one below the other are described as
            <em>block</em> elements, in contrast to <em>inline</em> elements,
            which appear one beside the other, like the individual words in a
            paragraph.
          </p>
          <p class="important-note">
            <strong>Note</strong>: The direction in which block element contents
            are laid out is described as the Block Direction. The Block
            Direction runs vertically in a language such as English, which has a
            horizontal writing mode. It would run horizontally in any language
            with a Vertical Writing Mode, such as Japanese. The corresponding
            Inline Direction is the direction in which inline contents (such as
            a sentence) would run.
          </p>
          <p>
            For many of the elements on your page the normal flow will create
            exactly the layout you need, however for more complex layouts you
            will need to alter this default behavior using some of the tools
            available to you in CSS. Starting with a well-structured HTML
            document is very important, as you can then work with the way things
            are laid out by default rather than fighting against it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The methods that can change how elements are laid out in CSS are as
            follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The display property</strong> — Standard values such as
              <code>block</code>, <code>inline</code> or
              <code>inline-block</code> can change how elements behave in normal
              flow, for example making a block-level element behave like an
              inline element (see
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#block_and_inline_boxes"
                >Types of CSS boxes</a
              >
              for more information). We also have entire layout methods that are
              switched on via specific <code>display</code> values, for example
              CSS Grid and Flexbox, which alter how elements inside the element
              they are set on are laid out.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Floats</strong> — Applying a float value such as
              <code>left</code> can cause block level elements to wrap alongside
              one side of an element, like the way images sometimes have text
              floating around them in magazine layouts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The position property</strong> — Allows you to precisely
              control the placement of boxes inside other boxes.
              <code>static</code>
              positioning is the default in normal flow, but you can cause
              elements to be laid out differently using other values, for
              example always fixed to the top of the browser viewport.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Table layout</strong> — features designed for styling the
              parts of an HTML table can be used on non-table elements using
              <code>display: table</code> and associated properties.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Multi-column layout</strong> — The Multi-column layout
              properties can cause the content of a block to layout in columns,
              as you might see in a newspaper.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="the_display_property">
        <header><h2>The display property</h2></header>
        <article>
          <p>
            The main methods of achieving page layout in CSS are all values of
            the <code>display</code> property. This property allows us to change
            the default way something displays. Everything in normal flow has a
            value of display, used as the default way that elements they are set
            on behave. For example, the fact that paragraphs in English display
            one below the other is due to the fact that they are styled with
            <code>display: block</code>. If you create a link around some text
            inside a paragraph, that link remains inline with the rest of the
            text, and doesn’t break onto a new line. This is because the
            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element is <code>display: inline</code> by
            default.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can change this default display behavior. For example, the
            <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element is <code>display: block</code> by
            default, meaning that list items display one below the other in our
            English document. If we change the display value to
            <code>inline</code> they now display next to each other, as words
            would do in a sentence. The fact that you can change the value of
            <code>display</code> for any element means that you can pick HTML
            elements for their semantic meaning, without being concerned about
            how they will look. The way they look is something that you can
            change.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to being able to change the default presentation by
            turning an item from <code>block</code> to <code>inline</code> and
            vice versa, there are some bigger layout methods that start out as a
            value of <code>display</code>. However, when using these, you will
            generally need to invoke additional properties. The two values most
            important for our purposes when discussing layout are
            <code>display: flex</code> and <code>display: grid</code>.
